  <h2>CEBU HOPPING</h2>
  <p>
    Cebu Tours now opens the Mactan Island Hopping tour package, this year 2022,
    which will take you to Gilutungan Island, Caohagan Island and San Vicente in
    Olango Island which are located in Mactan, Cebu. All of these three islands
    have marine sanctuaries wherein you can explore with the sight of abundant
    corals and hundreds of tropical fish species. With the assistance of our
    boatman, you can do snorkeling, diving and you can even take nice pictures
    with the scenic views of these islands.
