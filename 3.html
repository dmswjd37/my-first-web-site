      Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles,
      are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira.
      The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill,
      leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles.
      All six of the sea turtle species present in US waters
      (all of those listed above except the flatback) are listed as endangered
      and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
      The seventh sea turtle species is the flatback, which exists in the waters
      of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.Sea turtles can be separated
      into the categories of hard-shelled (cheloniid) and leathery-shelled
      (dermochelyid).There is only one dermochelyid species which is the leatherback
      sea turtle.
