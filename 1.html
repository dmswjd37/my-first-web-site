    <h2>Whale shark이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark" target="_blank">The <strong><u>whale shark</u> (Rhincodon typus)</strong></a> is a slow-moving,
      filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species.
      The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8 m (61.7 ft).
      The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom,
      most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate.
      It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of
      the family Rhincodontidae, which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in
      the class Chondrichthyes. Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into
      Rhinodontidae.</p>

    <p>The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely
    found in water below 21 °C (70 °F).
    Studies looking at vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming
    sharks have estimated whale shark lifespans at 80–130 years.
    Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding
    mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark.
    They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes, and pose no threat to humans.</p>
